/// #2787/#1498 — whether the GPS-recording foreground service may be requested.
///
/// #2766 promotes the recording GPS stream to an Android foreground service to
/// beat the OS's ~5 s background batching. But the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
/// permission is `tools:node="remove"`'d from AndroidManifest.xml for the Open
/// Testing release (#1498 — ship without triggering Google Play's "Foreground
/// Service Use" form). With the permission gone, geolocator's `startForeground`
/// throws `Permission Denial: startForeground … requires FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
/// and the GPS stream never starts — the trip captures zero fixes and is
/// discarded as "no movement" (error log #17).
///
/// While this is `false` the recorder streams **foreground-only**, which is
/// reliable because the recording screen pins itself (screen-on by default,
/// #2785).
///
/// ## The un-throttle trigger (#3173)
///
/// The restore is a single build flag, so it ships dark and flips the day
/// the Play form clears — no code change, no forgotten manifest sibling:
///
/// ```
/// flutter build appbundle --flavor play --dart-define=FGS_FORM_APPROVED=true
/// ```
///
/// The SAME define drives BOTH halves of the restore in lockstep:
///   1. **Dart** — this flag turns `true`, so [recordingLocationSettings]
///      passes geolocator the [ForegroundNotificationConfig] (the actual
///      un-throttle lever) and the Android Auto / auto-record Dart side
///      finds its native service.
///   2. **Manifest** — `android/app/build.gradle.kts` decodes the
///      `dart-defines` Gradle property Flutter forwards and, when the flag
///      is set, swaps the flavor manifest overlay for the `*FgsApproved`
///      variant that re-declares the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE*` permissions and
///      the `AutoRecordForegroundService` (restore points formerly
///      commented in `AndroidManifest.xml`).
///
/// Keeping the two halves on one define removes the historical failure
/// mode (#2787 / error log #17): flag on + permission absent =
/// `startForeground` Permission Denial = zero GPS fixes. Without the
/// define every build stays byte-identical to today's Play-compliant
/// shape (no `FOREGROUND_SERVICE*` permission in the merged manifest, so
/// the Open-Testing upload never 403s on the #1498 form).
///
/// `bool.fromEnvironment` is opaque to the analyzer, so the gated
/// `ForegroundNotificationConfig` branch stays compiled + visible (the old
/// `final`-not-`const` trick is no longer needed).

/// #2766 — the platform-specific [LocationSettings] used while a trip is
/// **actively recording**, so the GPS trace stays fine-grained (~1 s) instead
/// of the ~5 s the OS batches a backgrounded `getPositionStream` down to.
///
/// ## Why a bare `LocationSettings` throttles
///
/// `LocationSettings(accuracy: high)` carries no interval, no distance filter,
/// and — on Android — does **not** promote geolocator to a foreground service.
/// Once the recording screen is backgrounded (driving, screen off) Android
/// batches fixes to a ~5000 ms median, coarsening the polyline + every
/// distance / fuel analytic derived from it.
///
/// ## The un-throttle levers (per platform, via the plugin pattern)
///
///   * **Android** — an [AndroidSettings] with `intervalDuration: 1 s`,
///     `distanceFilter: 0`, and a [ForegroundNotificationConfig]. The
///     foreground service is the actual lever: it raises geolocator_android's
///     priority so the OS stops the ~5 s batching while the persistent
///     notification is showing. `enableWakeLock` keeps the CPU awake for the
///     fixes. Title/text come from the already-localized ARB keys.
///   * **iOS** — an [AppleSettings] with `activityType:
///     automotiveNavigation` (CLLocationManager tunes accuracy/cadence for a
///     car), `allowBackgroundLocationUpdates: true`, and
///     `pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically: false` so iOS does not auto-pause
///     updates when it thinks the user stopped moving.
///
/// ## Platform selection (no inline `Platform.isX` in business logic)
///
/// Selection is on [defaultTargetPlatform] — the same idiom
/// `auto_record_orchestrator_factories.dart` and `pip_controller.dart` use —
/// so tests drive it with `debugDefaultTargetPlatform`. An explicit
/// [platform] override is also accepted for direct unit testing.
///
/// ## Battery bound
///
/// This is the fine, foreground-service-promoted profile. It is requested
/// ONLY by the recording pipeline, and the shared position source is
/// refcounted to the trip lifecycle (opens on the first trip listener,
/// cancels on the last), so the wakelock + 1 s cadence apply only while a
/// trip is actively recording. The interval is a self-bounded 1000 ms with
/// `distanceFilter: 0` — never geolocator's unbounded "fastest".
///
/// #3112 — [approachLocationSettings] is the radar/approach-detector sibling:
/// not foreground-service-promoted and no l10n, but it MUST still pass iOS the
/// `pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically: false` flag — a bare `LocationSettings`
/// lets iOS CoreLocation auto-pause the stream when it thinks the user stopped
/// (red light / fuel stop), freezing the radar after its first scan ("radar
/// stuck on iPhone"). Android's bare high-accuracy stream does not auto-pause,
/// so it is left unchanged. `automotiveNavigation` + `allowBackgroundLocationUpdates`
/// mirror the recorder so the #2065 PiP approach keeps receiving fixes.

///   * `distanceFilter: 25` m — only re-emit (and re-rank) after a meaningful
///     move, so a parked/idle user doesn't spin the CPU re-ranking identical
///     fixes while a moving one still ticks the distance down smoothly;
///   * iOS `pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically: false` — the #3112 lesson: a
///     bare `LocationSettings` lets CoreLocation auto-pause the stream when it
///     thinks the user stopped, freezing the live distance. Updates keep
